I'm conducting educational research on implementing agile methodologies in web programming instruction. I have 19 VTT transcript files in Ukrainian from live sessions including sprint meetings and stand-ups. I need to design a Python-based analysis system to extract meaningful insights from these transcripts.

Context:
- Language: Ukrainian
- Format: VTT (WebVTT subtitle files)
- Sessions: Introduction, 3 Sprints (3 parts each), 9 Stand-ups
- Research Focus: Effectiveness of agile methods in teaching web programming
- Expected participants: Teacher(s) and students

Please help me design a comprehensive analysis framework that includes:

1. Data Processing Strategy:
   - Best practices for parsing VTT files and handling Ukrainian text
   - Speaker diarization techniques for educational transcripts
   - Timestamp preservation for temporal analysis

2. Key Metrics & Patterns to Extract:
   - Student engagement indicators (questions, responses, participation frequency)
   - Agile adoption patterns (terminology usage, sprint progression)
   - Problem identification (technical issues, conceptual difficulties, process challenges)
   - Teaching effectiveness markers
   - Collaboration patterns in stand-ups

3. Analysis Methodologies:
   - Qualitative coding schemes for educational transcripts
   - Sentiment analysis considerations for Ukrainian text
   - Topic modeling approaches for technical discussions
   - Conversation flow analysis
   - Progress tracking across sprints

4. Research Questions to Address:
   - How does student participation evolve across sprints?
   - What agile concepts are most/least understood?
   - What technical challenges emerge repeatedly?
   - How effective are stand-ups for student learning?

5. Visualization & Reporting:
   - Key charts/graphs for educational research papers
   - Statistical tests appropriate for this data
   - Ways to present qualitative findings

Please provide a structured approach with specific Python libraries and methodological recommendations for educational research validity.
